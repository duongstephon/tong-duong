            <p className="story__text-1">Stephon and Chelsia technically met in high school… though “met” might be generous. Chelsia mostly avoided Stephon back then, convinced he ran with the wrong crowd (translation: too loud and too chaotic).</p>
            <p className="story__text-2">Fast forward a few years and they ended up in the same program at the University of Waterloo. With shared classes and a tight science friend group, they saw each other pretty much every day and quickly became best friends. Between movie nights, study sessions, and good eats, they were inseparable but still “just friends.”</p>  
            <p className="story__text-3">By the summer of 2019, one of them caught feelings for the other. We won’t name names, but someone took just a smidge longer than the other. Eventually, Stephon caught up thanks to some good-natured teasing from his guy friends and a Christmas break packed with hangouts. After that, it was enough for him to finally clue in that maybe, just maybe, he liked her too.</p>  
            <p className="story__text-4">They made it official on February 24, 2020, a date in remembrance of Kobe Bryant, Stephon’s first love. Thankful that he didn’t wait till February 29 given 2020 was a leap year, Stephon and Chelsia now stand before you counting down the days to their wedding. They can’t wait to celebrate this next chapter surrounded by all the people they love most, friends, family, and everyone who has been part of their journey so far.</p>
            <p className="story__text-5">They say love is priceless, but the custom wedding merch they’re working on? That’s free for anyone interested.</p>
